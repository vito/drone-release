Using Puppet
=============

.. note::

   Please note this is a community contributed installation path. The
   only 'official' installation is using the :ref:`ubuntu_linux`
   installation path. This version may sometimes be out of date.

Requirements
------------

To use this guide you'll need a working installation of Puppet from
`Puppetlabs <https://www.puppetlabs.com>`_ .

The module also currently uses the official PPA so only works with Ubuntu.

Installation
------------

The module is available on the `Puppet Forge
<https://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/docker/>`_ and can be installed
using the built-in module tool.

.. code-block:: bash

   puppet module install garethr/docker

It can also be found on `GitHub
<https://www.github.com/garethr/garethr-docker>`_ if you would rather
download the source.

Usage
-----

The module provides a puppet class for installing Docker and two defined types
for managing images and containers.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: ruby

  include 'docker'

Images
~~~~~~

The next step is probably to install a Docker image. For this, we have a
defined type which can be used like so:

.. code-block:: ruby

  docker::image { 'ubuntu': }

This is equivalent to running:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker pull ubuntu

Note that it will only be downloaded if an image of that name does 
not already exist. This is downloading a large binary so on first 
run can take a while. For that reason this define turns off the 
default 5 minute timeout for the exec type. Note that you can also
remove images you no longer need with:

.. code-block:: ruby

  docker::image { 'ubuntu':
    ensure => 'absent',
  }

Containers
~~~~~~~~~~

Now you have an image where you can run commands within a container
managed by Docker.

.. code-block:: ruby

  docker::run { 'helloworld':
    image   => 'ubuntu',
    command => '/bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"',
  }

This is equivalent to running the following command, but under upstart:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker run -d ubuntu /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"

Run also contains a number of optional parameters:

.. code-block:: ruby

  docker::run { 'helloworld':
    image        => 'ubuntu',
    command      => '/bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"',
    ports        => ['4444', '4555'],
    volumes      => ['/var/lib/couchdb', '/var/log'],
    volumes_from => '6446ea52fbc9',
    memory_limit => 10485760, # bytes
    username     => 'example',
    hostname     => 'example.com',
    env          => ['FOO=BAR', 'FOO2=BAR2'],
    dns          => ['8.8.8.8', '8.8.4.4'],
  }

Note that ports, env, dns and volumes can be set with either a single string
or as above with an array of values.
