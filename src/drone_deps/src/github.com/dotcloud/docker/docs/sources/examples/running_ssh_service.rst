SSH Daemon Service
==================

.. include:: example_header.inc


**Video:**

I've created a little screencast to show how to create an SSHd service
and connect to it. It is something like 11 minutes and not entirely
smooth, but it gives you a good idea.

.. note::
   This screencast was created before Docker version 0.5.2, so the
   daemon is unprotected and available via a TCP port. When you run
   through the same steps in a newer version of Docker, you will
   need to add ``sudo`` in front of each ``docker`` command in order
   to reach the daemon over its protected Unix socket.

You can also get this sshd container by using:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker pull dhrp/sshd


The password is ``screencast``.

**Video's Transcription:**

.. code-block:: bash

         # Hello! We are going to try and install openssh on a container and run it as a service
         # let's pull ubuntu to get a base ubuntu image. 
         $ docker pull ubuntu
         # I had it so it was quick
         # now let's connect using -i for interactive and with -t for terminal 
         # we execute /bin/bash to get a prompt.
         $ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
         # yes! we are in!
         # now lets install openssh
         $ apt-get update
         $ apt-get install openssh-server
         # ok. lets see if we can run it.
         $ which sshd
         # we need to create privilege separation directory
         $ mkdir /var/run/sshd
         $ /usr/sbin/sshd
         $ exit
         # now let's commit it

         # I gave the name dhrp/sshd for the container
         # now we can run it again 
         $ docker run -d dhrp/sshd /usr/sbin/sshd -D # D for daemon mode 
         # is it running?
         $ docker ps

Update:
-------

For Ubuntu 13.10 using stackbrew/ubuntu, you may need do these additional steps:

1. change /etc/pam.d/sshd, pam_loginuid line 'required' to 'optional'
2. echo LANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\" > /etc/default/locale
