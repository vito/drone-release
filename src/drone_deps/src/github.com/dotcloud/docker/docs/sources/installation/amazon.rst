Amazon EC2
==========

.. include:: install_header.inc

There are several ways to install Docker on AWS EC2:

* :ref:`amazonquickstart` or
* :ref:`amazonstandard`

**You'll need an** `AWS account <http://aws.amazon.com/>`_ **first, of course.**

.. _amazonquickstart:

Amazon QuickStart
-----------------

1. **Choose an image:**

   * Launch the `Create Instance Wizard
     <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#LaunchInstanceWizard:>`_ menu
     on your AWS Console.

   * Click the ``Select`` button for a 64Bit Ubuntu image. For example: Ubuntu Server 12.04.3 LTS

   * For testing you can use the default (possibly free)
     ``t1.micro`` instance (more info on `pricing
     <http://aws.amazon.com/en/ec2/pricing/>`_).

   * Click the ``Next: Configure Instance Details`` button at the bottom right.

2. **Tell CloudInit to install Docker:**

   * When you're on the "Configure Instance Details" step, expand the "Advanced
     Details" section.

   * Under "User data", select "As text".

   * Enter ``#include https://get.docker.io`` into the instance *User Data*.
     `CloudInit <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit>`_ is part of the
     Ubuntu image you chose; it will bootstrap Docker by running the shell
     script located at this URL.

3. After a few more standard choices where defaults are probably ok, your AWS
   Ubuntu instance with Docker should be running!

**If this is your first AWS instance, you may need to set up your
Security Group to allow SSH.** By default all incoming ports to your
new instance will be blocked by the AWS Security Group, so you might
just get timeouts when you try to connect.

Installing with ``get.docker.io`` (as above) will create a service named
``lxc-docker``. It will also set up a :ref:`docker group <dockergroup>` and you
may want to add the *ubuntu* user to it so that you don't have to use ``sudo``
for every Docker command.

Once you've got Docker installed, you're ready to try it out -- head
on over to the :doc:`../use/basics` or :doc:`../examples/index` section.

.. _amazonstandard:

Standard Ubuntu Installation
----------------------------

If you want a more hands-on installation, then you can follow the
:ref:`ubuntu_linux` instructions installing Docker on any EC2 instance
running Ubuntu. Just follow Step 1 from :ref:`amazonquickstart` to
pick an image (or use one of your own) and skip the step with the
*User Data*. Then continue with the :ref:`ubuntu_linux` instructions.

Continue with the :ref:`hello_world` example.
