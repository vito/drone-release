Check your Docker install
-------------------------

This guide assumes you have a working installation of Docker. To check
your Docker install, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Check that you have a working install
    $ sudo docker info

If you get ``docker: command not found`` or something like
``/var/lib/docker/repositories: permission denied`` you may have an incomplete
Docker installation or insufficient privileges to access docker on your machine.

Please refer to :ref:`installation_list` for installation instructions.


.. _hello_world:

Hello World
-----------

.. include:: example_header.inc

This is the most basic example available for using Docker.

Download the small base image named ``busybox``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Download a busybox image
    $ sudo docker pull busybox

The ``busybox`` image is a minimal Linux system. You can do the same
with any number of other images, such as ``debian``, ``ubuntu`` or ``centos``.
The images can be found and retrieved using the `Docker index`_.

.. _Docker index: http://index.docker.io

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo docker run busybox /bin/echo hello world

This command will run a simple ``echo`` command, that will echo ``hello world`` back to the console over standard out.

**Explanation:**

- **"sudo"** execute the following commands as user *root*
- **"docker run"** run a command in a new container
- **"busybox"** is the image we are running the command in.
- **"/bin/echo"** is the command we want to run in the container
- **"hello world"** is the input for the echo command

.. _hello_world_daemon:

Hello World Daemon
------------------

.. include:: example_header.inc

And now for the most boring daemon ever written!

We will use the Ubuntu image to run a simple hello world daemon that will just print hello
world to standard out every second. It will continue to do this until
we stop it.

**Steps:**

.. code-block:: bash

    container_id=$(sudo docker run -d ubuntu /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done")

We are going to run a simple hello world daemon in a new container
made from the ``ubuntu`` image.

- **"sudo docker run -d "** run a command in a new container. We pass "-d"
  so it runs as a daemon.
- **"ubuntu"** is the image we want to run the command inside of.
- **"/bin/sh -c"** is the command we want to run in the container
- **"while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"** is the mini
  script we want to run, that will just print hello world once a
  second until we stop it.
- **$container_id** the output of the run command will return a
  container id, we can use in future commands to see what is going on
  with this process.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker logs $container_id

Check the logs make sure it is working correctly.

- **"docker logs**" This will return the logs for a container
- **$container_id** The Id of the container we want the logs for.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker attach --sig-proxy=false $container_id

Attach to the container to see the results in real-time.

- **"docker attach**" This will allow us to attach to a background
  process to see what is going on.
- **"--sig-proxy=false"** Do not forward signals to the container; allows
  us to exit the attachment using Control-C without stopping the container.
- **$container_id** The Id of the container we want to attach too.

Exit from the container attachment by pressing Control-C.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker ps

Check the process list to make sure it is running.

- **"docker ps"** this shows all running process managed by docker

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker stop $container_id

Stop the container, since we don't need it anymore.

- **"docker stop"** This stops a container
- **$container_id** The Id of the container we want to stop.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker ps

Make sure it is really stopped.
