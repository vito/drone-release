Red Hat Enterprise Linux 
========================

.. include:: install_header.inc

.. include:: install_unofficial.inc

Docker is available for **RHEL** on EPEL. These instructions should work for
both RHEL and CentOS. They will likely work for other binary compatible EL6
distributions as well, but they haven't been tested.

Please note that this package is part of `Extra Packages for Enterprise
Linux (EPEL)`_, a community effort to create and maintain additional packages
for the RHEL distribution.

Also note that due to the current Docker limitations, Docker is able to run
only on the **64 bit** architecture.

Installation
------------

Firstly, you need to install the EPEL repository. Please follow the `EPEL installation instructions`_.


The ``docker-io`` package provides Docker on EPEL.


If you already have the (unrelated) ``docker`` package installed, it will
conflict with ``docker-io``. There's a `bug report`_ filed for it.
To proceed with ``docker-io`` installation, please remove
``docker`` first.


Next, let's install the ``docker-io`` package which will install Docker on our host.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo yum -y install docker-io

To update the ``docker-io`` package

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo yum -y update docker-io

Now that it's installed, let's start the Docker daemon.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo service docker start

If we want Docker to start at boot, we should also:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo chkconfig docker on

Now let's verify that Docker is working.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo docker run -i -t fedora /bin/bash

**Done!**, now continue with the :ref:`hello_world` example.

Issues?
